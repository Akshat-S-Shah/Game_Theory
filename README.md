# Abstract
In today’s world, games are played on computers, and some of the most attractive, engaging games are bouncing balls. In these, the ball/s is/are shot on the targets above. The target is to break as many balls as we can before they come down. So for these real-life problems, we are going to use Matrices, vector space and 2d geometry. For implementing the concepts of mathematics in coding, we are going to use Java and their packages.
